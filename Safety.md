## Some words about safety of your Applebytes
* Applebytes in Applebyte Wallet are stored on the device.
* **If you lose your device, you'll lose your Applebytes.**  Just like money in your physical wallet.
* **Before uninstalling Applebyte Wallet** (or clearing app data/wiping your device), **transfer your Applebytes to another wallet**. Any remaining Applebytes will be lost.
* **Transactions cannot be undone!** If you send your Applebytes into the void, there is no way to get them back unless you know the receiver and she is willing to send them back.
* **Keep your mobile device safe!** Do only install apps you fully trust.  Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
* Keep the risk low! **Only use Applebyte Wallet with small amounts** for day use, and keep your Applebyte savings at a safer place.
